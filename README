We implemented a dualfold strategy in attacking the problem of the STRIPS planner. We identified two areas where the current planning agent was falling short. First, the agent was identifying impossible actions as a strategy for goal attainment (i.e. moving Pole 3 onto Disk 1). Secondly, we saw that the system naturally prioritized trivial goals over fundamental ones, and fell into an infinite loop when these two goals were at odds. To tackle this problem, we created the remove_bad_moves() function to eliminate impossible goals from our agent, and we updated the sorting function to prioritize harder, more fundamental goals (larger disks) over the more trivial ones (smaller disks). This model delivers optimal solutions for 2 and 3-disk puzzles, and can we believe also solves 4-disk puzzle optimally. Our agent requires no special instructions.

When running our agent in the 3d OpenNero simulation the linear planner window does not show up and the agent thinks it has reached the goal state before anything has started. The mystrips.py originally had this same behavior.  Our algorithm's solution output can be attained by running the python commands given in the homework assignment. By running this command, the linear solver window appears and the solution plans can be attained by stepping through the algorithm or skipping to the end.
